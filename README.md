My version of the project does scoping and checks of undeclared variables. The naming of nodes might be different from spec, but it is fully functional in terms of error checking and semantic analysis. The projects printing the tree uses the utility snippets from https://github.com/grosenberg/SnippetsTest for printing prettier trees and formating. All my syntax errors are being reported at the top of the output and semantic errors are reported when the line shows up.
